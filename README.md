# Puppeteer practice
Just a Puppeteer tool practice

## How to run
1. Install all dependencies:
`install_puppeteer.sh`
2. Run tests `npm test`

## Notes:
I didn't really enjoy investigating this tool, cause it's kinda pure according to the Selenium and needs to add waiters for each page switching. IDK, maybe I was badly searching, but I didn't find any global `pageLoad`, or `implicitWait`
